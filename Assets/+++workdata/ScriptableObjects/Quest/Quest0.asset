  questDetailedDescription: "With his home having been attacked, Ven\u2019s clan
    forced him to run away and survive on his own. The young leader obliged, though
    with hesitation and a heavy heart. He can\u2019t think of anything else but the
    guilt eating him up from the inside, wrapping itself around him like it\u2019s
    about to suffocate him.  \n\nHe has no choice, though. His death would mean utter
    chaos for the remaining members of the Petrichor clan. So he runs. "
