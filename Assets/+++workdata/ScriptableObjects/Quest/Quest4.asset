  questDetailedDescription: "With the newfound information about Mount Zeatin, Ven
    and Kei\u2019an now have to find gifts to offer up to a so-called \u201Cemissary\u201D.
    They don\u2019t know much about them, thus Ven isn\u2019t too fond of the idea.\r\n\nNot
    that he has much of a choice, anyway.\r\n"
