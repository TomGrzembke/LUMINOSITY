  sentences:
  - "Kei\u2019an! Been a while. Who\u2019s your friend? "
  - This is Ven! Long story short, we need your help.
  - 'How do we get back to my city fastest from here? '
  - "Well, that\u2019d be the exit to the north. "
  - 'Alright, thank y- '
  - 'But! '
  - "Aaand there\u2019s the catch. What a surprise. "
  - 'It only opens for those accepted by The Mountain. '
  - "And how, if you\u2019d be so kind, do we get its approval? "
  - "There\u2019s an emissary of The Mountain who we offer up gifts to."
  - Your best shot is to get some food, a weapon and maybe something like armor.
  - "Li\u2019l critter wants to get stronger."
  - " A bat stole a gift I prepared, actually. If you find it, I\u2019ll let you
    use it in my stead."
  - "Other than that, it shouldn't be too hard to find stuff \u2018round here. You
    can then put it down at the altar in the center of the city. "
  - "So\u2026 we\u2019re making some deity-thing we don\u2019t know stronger when
    it could possibly not approve of and kill us. "
  - "Sounds fool-proof! Let\u2019s go Ven. "
  - 'Take care, and good luck. '
