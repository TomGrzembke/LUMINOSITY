  sentences:
  - 'This place never changed. '
  - 'Never been here before. '
  - I know! I always wanted to show you, but neither your father nor Vara let me
    take you here.
  - "I told them I\u2019d watch over you, even if you\u2019re capable enough on your
    own, but they never thought I\u2019m up to the task."
  - Well, here we are now.
  - "Yeah, here we are, and you still don\u2019t need to watch over me."
  - Aw, come on, can you at least play along and be a damsel in distress for one
    minute?
  - In your dreams, maybe.
  - How did you know!?
  - "Very funny. Let\u2019s go now."
